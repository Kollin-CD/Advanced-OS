To compile this memory coordinator: 
1) Open a terminal and go to this directory
2) Run the command "make"

To Run this memory coordinator:
1) Set maximum memory where it has to be less than the host (my code does not check for this condition!)
2) Create and start any number of virtual machines.
3) Run the monitor.py to see performance
4) Run command "./memory_coordinator <period(s)>" I typically do a period between 0.25 and 1 seconds
5) Run processes on the virtual machines like the python files in test/cpu. 
6) See the output on the console and monitor.py (there is a chart which can be modified).
